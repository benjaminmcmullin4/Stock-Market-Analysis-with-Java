# Stock Market Analysis with Java
For my CS 2420 final project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of stock market performance using Java. Leveraging the power of Java's robust programming features and libraries, I delved into examining the performance of various stocks in the market. With Java, I was able to gather and process extensive financial data efficiently, enabling me to analyze the trends and behaviors of different stocks over time.

Throughout the project, I utilized Java's object-oriented programming paradigm to structure my analysis code in a modular and scalable manner. This approach allowed me to easily manage and manipulate large datasets, perform complex calculations, and generate insightful visualizations to understand the dynamics of the stock market.

By employing Java for this project, I not only demonstrated my proficiency in software development and data analysis but also gained valuable insights into the practical applications of programming in financial analysis. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, I was able to draw meaningful conclusions about the performance of various stocks, contributing to a deeper understanding of financial markets.

Overall, my project showcased the versatility and effectiveness of Java in tackling real-world challenges in finance, underscoring its significance in the realm of computational finance and investment analysis.
